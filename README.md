# Soil Meter with Raspberry Pi Pico ðŸŒ±  

This project aims to develop a **soil meter** using the **Raspberry Pi Pico**, capable of measuring **temperature** and **electrical conductivity (EC)**. The device is designed for agricultural and gardening applications, helping users monitor soil conditions for better plant growth.  

## Features  
- **Temperature Measurement** 
- **Electrical Conductivity (EC) Measurement**  
- **Raspberry Pi Pico-based** 
- **Efficient and Low-Power Design**   

## Technologies & Components  
- **Raspberry Pi Pico** as the microcontroller  
- **Temperature sensor** (e.g., DS18B20, thermistor)  
- **EC sensor** for soil conductivity measurement  
- **Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) for sensor readings**  
- **Data processing and display options** (e.g., LCD, serial output)  

This open-source project is perfect for hobbyists, researchers, and farmers looking to optimize soil conditions.
